        <p>
          To commemorate 2020, the Houston Parks Board (HPB) wanted to find a
          way to mark the occasion and highlight reaching their goal of raising
          $225 million for the Bayou Greenways Initiative. And because this was
          during Covid, they wanted to do a digital annual report because it
          could reach a broader section of the community, build awareness and
          appreciation for why parks matter and increase HPB's ability to
          connect with current and future donors.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a designer with the Black Sheep Agency, I created site designs,
          wireframes and interactive prototypes to build an engaging digital
          annual report, while also adhering to brand guidelines. We created a
          better, more improved annual report experience to bring the Houston
          Parks Board into the modern era.
          <br />
          <br />
          We received anecdotal feedback that the web-based report was a
          refreshing way to view HPB's accomplishments and users loved that it
          provided a different user experience. We also received reports that
          users loved reading stories that tied the parks to individuals in the
          community.
