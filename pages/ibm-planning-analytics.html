            IBM Planning Analytics (PA) is a complete planning and analytics
            solution that helps organizations drive efficiency and uncover new
            insights directly from their data. And the web experience, the main
            marketing tool used to sell the product, had reached an inflection
            point. It was crowded with too much information (45+ pages) and not
            visually cohesive, which made it confusing to navigate and led to
            underperforming expectations. <br />
            <br />
            We needed to give users a fresh experience and prioritize the
            information they wanted to see when it came to learning about the
            product. The old site was not taking advantage of high-traffic areas
            and lacked a clear design vision, contributing to a sense of clutter
            and information overload. This is where we applied design, UI/UX and
            analytics to solve the problem. An improved IBM Planning Analytics
            design created an experience that had a demonstrable positive impact
            on the business. <br />
            <br />
            As a result of the design overhaul, there was a 14% increase in
            sign-ups for product demos leading to a connection with the IBM
            Sales team. In addition, there was also a 13.7% increase in organic
            entry visits because the new navigation and sitemap were aligned
            with the SEO team.
